/**
 * This interface binds an @ref asset_management_system "asset
 * management system's" bespoke UI into OpenAssetIO.
 *
 * It is not called directly by a @ref host, but by the middleware that
 * presents a more object-oriented model of this to the @ref host -
 * namely, the @fqref{ui.hostApi.UIDelegate} "UIDelegate".
 *
 * Logging and Error Handling
 * --------------------------
 *
 * The supplied @fqref{managerApi.HostSession} "HostSession" object
 * provides access to a logger that allow messages and progress to be
 * reported back to the user. All logging should go through these
 * methods otherwise it may not be correctly presented to the user. The
 * loose term "user" also covers developers, who may need to see log
 * output for debugging and other purposes.
 *
 * @see @fqref{managerApi.HostSession.logger} "HostSession.logger"
 * @see @fqref{log.LoggerInterface} "LoggerInterface"
 *
 * Exceptions should be thrown to handle any in-flight errors that
 * occur. The error should be mapped to a derived class of
 * exceptions.OpenAssetIOException, and thrown.  All exceptions of this
 * kind will be correctly passed across the plug-in C boundary,
 * and re-thrown. Other exceptions should not be used.
 *
 *  @see @fqref{errors} "errors"
 *
 * Hosts
 * -----
 *
 * Sometimes you may need to know more information about the API host.
 * A @fqref{managerApi.Host} "Host" object is available through the
 * @fqref{managerApi.HostSession} "HostSession" object passed to each
 * method of this class. This provides a standardised interface that all
 * API hosts guarantee to implement. This can be used to identify
 * exactly which host you are being called for, and query various entity
 * related specifics of the hosts data model.
 *
 * @see @fqref{managerApi.Host} "Host"
 *
 * Initialization
 * --------------
 *
 * The constructor makes a new instance, but at this point it is not
 * ready for use. Instances of this class should be lightweight to
 * create, but don't have to be lightweight to initialize. The
 * informational methods must be available pre-initialization, so that
 * queries can be made relatively cheaply to provide users with a list
 * of UI delegates and their settings. None of the UI-related methods
 * will be called until after @ref initialize has been called. The
 * following methods must be callable prior to initialization:
 *
 *    @li @ref identifier()
 *    @li @ref displayName()
 *    @li @ref info()
 *    @li @ref settings()
 *
 * @see @ref initialize
 *
 * @note OpenAssetIO makes use of shared pointers to facilitate object
 * lifetime management across multiple languages. Instances passed into
 * API methods via shared pointer may have their lifetimes extended
 * beyond that of your code.
